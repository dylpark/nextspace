📚 Design patterns with React Server Components (RSC)

💎 How to choose optimal rendering strategies

🚅 Dynamic routing and project organization

🔥 Advanced data fetching and caching

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```zsh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

To run migrations:

```zsh
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
